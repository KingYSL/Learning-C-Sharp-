# Learning-C-Sharp-
This is my attempt to learn and hopefully one day master programming. Hopefully i can document my process as best as i can and eventually be good enough to create something meaningful. The book i am reading is Visual c# 2012 by Joyce Farrell. All solutions posted here start from chapter 3 as i found the first two chapters unimportant.
